#Tamagotchi Game

## Overview
#### Creating a Tamagotchi Game with:
-HTML
-CSS
-Javascript

### App functionality:
Your Tamagotchi has 3 stats that will continuously increment by 1 point. If you let any of the stats reach 10 points, your Tamagotchi will die. You can click the buttons "Feed me", "Sleepy time", or "Play with me" to decrement by 1 point.

### Triumphs:
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build this game. I am especially impressed with the CSS, because I learned a little more about the language. 

### Challenges:
CSS and Javascript were challenging. Definitely eye opening to see how Javascript can build the functionality of the game. There were times I got stuck, but just kept testing it by trial and error to get it right.

### Words of Wisdom:
Your brain doesn't work properly by the 12th hour of coding. Eat something, shower, rest, come back to it tomorrow. 

### Code Snippets:
Please refer to HTML, CSS, and JS file.

### User Stories:
1. When the user enters there Tamagotchi name, the game will begin.
2. When the user clicks "Feed me", the Tamagotchi's Hunger will decrement by 1.
3. When the user clicks "Sleepy time", the Tamagotchi's sleepiness will decrement by 1.
4. When the user clicks "Play with me", the Tamagotchi's boredom will decrement by 1.
5. The only way to win is to keep the user's Tamagotchi alive.
6. If any of the scores reach 10, the user's Tamagotchi is dead.
